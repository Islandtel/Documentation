## Introduction Maekongplaza

The country of Thailand is located in the Mekong sub-region, South East Asia.The north part of Thailand is an area of the plateau. There are mountains and plains. The south part of Thailand is located between the Andaman sea and the Gulf of Thailand near the South China sea. So there are three different climates with rain forests, seasides, mountains, and highlands

People know Thailand as a country of tourism. Most of the people are Buddhist. Thai people are full of smiles and hospitality (so call the land of smiles). The people are friendly toward other.\
So Thailand becomes the most popular for every traveler around the world. The statistics in the year 2016, found that 20 million people come to visit Thailand. The year 2017 found that 30 million people had come. In the year 2018 will increase up to 40 million people. There are rising in the number of tourists coming from around the world. From 30-40% of the tourists travel to the north region of Thailand call Chiangmai.\
Chiang-Mai has become the center of the northern part where you can find great accommodations, services and entertainment. The full commercial for tourism opens until dawn.

One of the main destinations for northern tourists is to visit Chiang Rai. Most of the visitors come to Chiang Mai and then go visit a nearby province called “Chiang Rai”. The main problem is the transportation between these two provinces. Normally, all travelers will spend 8 hours by car for a round trip. That means all most a day for just transportation.

Chiang Rai province is located in the northeast part of Thailand by the Mekong River. The land are adjacent to Myanmar and Laos borders. The Mekong river can connect to the 12 Panna, which is a province of China. The province has many scenic and interesting places like Doi Tung, Dai Mae Salong, Phu Chi Fa, Doi Phang, Doi Vavi, etc. Furthermore, famous art and culture are here such as Phra Kaew temple, Wat Rong Khun, Doi Tung Rogal Villa, The Blackhouse Museum, The wooden elephant Museum, etc.

Tourists who come to visit Chang Rai are more than ten million visitors per year, but now still lacks accommodations and facilities. So it cannot attract tourists to stay in Chiang Rai. Mostly they will stay in Chiang Mai and visit on a one-day trip to Chiang Rai.

A big issue about transportation has occurred. The 8 hours by car may cause an accident. The motorway project is still the solution at the end note. The tourists still need to journey nearly 300 kilometers and waste the time in the car. Travelers can visit only 1-2 places because of the time limit. For explorers all over Chiang Rai province, it will take at least 3 or 4 days to be appropriate to many sights and impressive experiences of the heart of Chiang Rai and Myanmar-Lao borders.
