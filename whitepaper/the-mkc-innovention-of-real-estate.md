# The MKC Innovention of Real estate

​Maekong Plaza Coin (hereinafter “MKC”) is building a next generation global real-estate investment based on blockchain technology. We believe blockchain has the potential to help accelerate the adoption of the Sharing Economy which has already begun to unleash industry disruption by opening up significant amounts of previously untapped private capacity and tokenization of property may completely change real estate transactions and ownership transfer as we know them.\


That is why we are using the token crowd sale mechanism to pre-sale our product and finance development as opposed to traditional venture capital. With a secure, tamper-proof system based on the blockchain, users can trade parcels of property on our platform and bypass intermediaries in rental deals, transacting P2P (peer-to-peer), all of which will enhance ease of use and security for guests\
and hosts alike, streamlining user experience and driving accelerated adoption. Real Estate is the largest asset class in the world, and also one of the most inadequate.

Our aim is to gain the market cap who are traveling in the northern part of Thailand with a large amount of 15 million tourists above staying and use our facilities and services for the whole year to reach our target income and share profit to all token holders. MKC platform is willing to transform the real estate into tokens, and subsequently PTO (Property Token Offering) and list them on exchanges, starting with the exchange based on Ethereum smart contracts. Such endeavor would ease the transfer of ownership, simplify fractional holding without minimal constraints, alleviate tax inefficiencies, make cross-border transactions simple, and eliminate substantial overhead faced in certain jurisdictions due to unnecessary middlemen. The tokenizing property will allow real estate assets to be uniquely identified via a digital record that contains information regarding occupancy, physical characteristics, legal status, historical performance, and financial position.\


While blockchain technology is still in its infancy, and a complete decentralized ledger of global property is not going to happen overnight, MKC plans to take a leading role in the real estate in Chiang Rai to make this a reality, starting with disrupting the rental market and tokenizing large real estate assets\
for trading. Please refer to our timeline below for a detailed overview of our current progress and future goals.
